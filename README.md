Welcome to Guess The Number!
Here are the simple rules you need to follow to play the game:
1. Choose your difficulty

You can choose between: easy, medium, hard and extreme.

If you decide on a custom game the program will ask you to enter the values yourself!

2. Start guessing!

Note that you have a set number of guesses:
easy:20;
medium:15;
hard & extreme:10;
custom:however you want;

The program will tell you if you succeeded or not after you are out of guesses or when you guess the number.
